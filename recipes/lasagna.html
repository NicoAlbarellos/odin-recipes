        <h2> Description</h2>
            <p>Lasagna is a traditional and iconic dish of Italian cuisine, consisting of layers of pasta interspersed with various ingredients that vary depending on the region and recipe. The classic version, originating from Emilia-Romagna, is made up of layers of fresh pasta, ragù sauce (a mix of ground beef and pork slow-cooked with tomato, onion, carrot, and celery), and a creamy béchamel sauce. These layers are repeated several times and topped with a generous layer of grated Parmesan cheese before being baked until the top is golden and bubbling.</p>
            <p>This dish is not only notable for its delicious taste and texture but also for its versatility. There are variations that include spinach and ricotta, mushrooms, or even vegetarian versions with an abundance of vegetables. Lasagna is not only a feast for the palate but also a reflection of the cultural richness and diversity of Italian cuisine, capable of adapting to different tastes and occasions. Served hot, each portion of lasagna reveals a complex and delightful symphony of flavors that transport diners to traditional Italian tables.</p>
